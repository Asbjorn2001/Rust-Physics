Experimental physics engine written in Rust using Piston. The engine uncludes rigid body circles and convex polygons. 
The bodies can be made of different materials which have different properties, like friction and restitution.
The engine also includes a 1d soft body structure, that updates using verlet integration instead of impulses.
